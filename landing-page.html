        <div class= "Background">
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>An Economics graduate from Kenyatta University and innate desire to grow and push self past the limits. Also studied Economics and Statistics at Kwara State University, Nigeria and experienced a tonne of cultures etc. I also worked at Equity Bank Limited after high school; a rare experience that allowed me to interact with professional environment at a young age.</p>
        <p>With such an extensive Economics background, taking up a Software Development may not, at first, strike anyone as an obvious answer.But my goal is to grow into an award winning web professional who can design, develop, consult, speak, and write excellent and user-prioritizing websites. My whole life has been guided by the constant motivation to <em>make things that make a difference</em>. The software development journey, at Moringa School in particular, has finally handed me the opportunity to engage my creativity, constantly challenge myself, and most importantly <strong>LEARN!</strong></p>
        <p>On top of holding every young developer's dream to become a kickass developer, I also aim at: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mastering Full Stack Web Development</li>
            <li>Working with teams in Google, ELEKS,Microsoft</li>
            <li>Freelancing, and the empowering autonomy.</li> </div>
        <div class= "Hobbies">
        <h4>Hobbies and Interests</h4>
        <p>Besides software development, I am a chess lover and a J.Cole stan. I derive extreme pleasure from mind-calming yet engaging games, films, music, and even people.The better part of my days are spent writing for charity and money.And now writing code for money.Maybe charity.</p>
        <p>Below are links to my first week's works! Greatly inspired by Samuel Beckett's unlikely mantra "Try Again, Fail Again, Fail Better".</p>
