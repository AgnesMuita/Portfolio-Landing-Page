        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Agnes Muita is relatively new in software development|With an unrelenting dream of becoming a developer hybrid.</p>
        <p>My goal is to grow into an award winning web professional who can design, develop, consult, speak, and write excellent and user-prioritizing websites. My whole life has been guided by the constant motivation to <em>make things that make a difference</em>. The software development journey, at Moringa School in particular, has finally handed me the opportunity to engage my creativity, hold challenges against myself, and most importantly <strong>LEARN!</strong></p>
        <p>Besides software development, I am a chess lover and a J.Cole stan. I derive extreme pleasure in mind-calming yet engaging games, films, music, and even people.</p>
        <p>Below are links to my first week's works! Greatly inspired by Samuel Beckett's unlikely mantra "Try Again, Fail Again, Fail Better".</p>
