            <p> 
                Hi! You can call me Aggie. I am a Nairobi-based writer-come-coder. Also an Economics graduate from Kenyatta University possessing a wild desire to grow and push myself past my own 'limits'. I also studied Economics and Statistics at Kwara State University, Nigeria and experienced a tonne of cultures, people etc. I also worked at Equity Bank Limited after high school; a rare experience that allowed me to interact with the professional environment at a young age.
            </p>

            <h3 class= "headers">Why Software Development Though?</h3>
            <p>
                With such an extensive Economics background, taking up Software Development may not, at first, strike anyone as an obvious answer.But my goal is to grow into an award winning web professional who can design, develop, consult, speak, and write excellent and user-prioritizing websites. My whole life has been guided by the constant motivation to <em>make things that make a difference</em>. The software development journey, at Moringa School in particular, has finally handed me the opportunity to engage my creativity, constantly challenge myself, and most importantly <strong>LEARN!</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                On top of holding every young developer's dream to become a kickass developer, I also aim at: 
                <ol>
                    <li>Working with teams at Google, ELEKS,Microsoft.</li>
                    <li>Freelancing, and achieving the empowering autonomy that comes with it.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Below are links to my first week's work! Greatly inspired by Samuel Beckett's unlikely mantra "Try Again, Fail Again, Fail Better":

            <p>
                 Besides software development, I am a chess lover and a J.Cole stan. I derive extreme pleasure from mind-calming yet engaging <span class= "interests">games, films, music, and even people.</span>The better part of my days are spent writing for charity and money.And now writing code for money.Maybe charity.
